My personal site.

Uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) for styling and layout. 

Build process is handled by [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). Utilizes [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and other goodies.

The site is automatically deployed from GitHub to the webserver by [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/).
